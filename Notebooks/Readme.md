## Home Credit Default Risk
Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.
Home Credit strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, Home Credit makes use of a variety of alternative data--including telco and transactional information--to predict their clients' repayment abilities.

This project is about predicting the probability that a home credit applicant will not repaid its loan. The datasets are rpovided by kaggle.
I use the provided elements to perform a deep analysis of the data. I started by an explanatory analysis , follow by an feature engenering in orger to keep the best feater that will lead to the highest possible accuracy of the model in the modeling part.
